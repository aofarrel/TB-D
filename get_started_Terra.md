# How to Install and Run TB-D on Terra
*If you are not using the cloud compute platform Terra, please see [this documentation](./get_started_nonTerra.md) instead. If you are unsure if you want to use Terra, try TB-D without it first.*

1. Import myco_raw from Dockstore
2. Import Tree Nine from Dockstore
3. [optional] Import Tree Seven and Tree Eight from Dockstore (only necessary for some metadata use cases)

Workflows from Dockstore are kept in sync with GitHub, even after you have imported the workflow. Using the dropdown menu in Terra's UI, you can select any branch or GitHub release of the workflow in question.

It's recommended to use whatever the latest GitHub release is for your workflows:
* myco: https://github.com/aofarrel/myco/releases
* Tree Nine:  https://github.com/aofarrel/tree_nine/releases
